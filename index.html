			<h1>The Problem</h1>
			<p>
				Do you know someone who has experienced an emergency where they have not received any information or follow-up? "What's going on?" "Where am I safe?" "What can I do?" These are questions that often arise during emergencies. 
				In these situations, when time is an issue, It may also be difficult to find relevant information quickly, which could lead to misunderstandings and potentially dangerous situations.
				To date there is no digital platform for emergency notifications in Norway. We are InfoLight and we seek to supply a solution to this problem.
			</p>

			<h2>A modern society</h2>
			<p>
				In today's society we have technological solutions for almost everything, and the modern citizen is steadily approaching an entirely digital life. 
				Digital solutions are both practical, fast, and they simplify our lives in countless ways. There are apps for nearly any situation, but in emergencies relevant information might be hard to find.
			</p>

			<h2>Dated Solutions</h2>

			<div class="blikkfang">
				The civil defence sirens and mass media .. are the only official tools for alerting the citizens in a crisis.
			</div>

			<p>
				Lives might be at stake, and it might be difficult to keep calm in stressful situations. 
				Simple tasks like navigating to information on your smartphone, can be extremely demanding under pressure. 
				During such events time is of an essence, and those precious minutes we spend to find information should rather be used on staying safe and helping others.
				Today’s norwegian solution consists of the civil defense sirens(tornado siren) and mass media, and these are the only official tools for alerting the citizens in a crisis. 
				As of today, there is no digital solution that communicates the message directly to the public in Norway. 
			</p>
			<h2>Misinformation</h2>
			<p>
				Poor information flow might lead rumours and misinformation. 
				As a result of this, some may even seek out the situation out of curiosity rather than keeping distance. 
				This might even result in additional difficulties and tasks for the police and emergency services, when they rather should spend time on saving lives.
			</p>
			<h1>Our solution</h1>
			<div class="liste_i_tekst">
				<ul>
					<li>Emergency alerts that can be tailored specifically for the user's location.</li>
					<li>Easier to receive relevant information than to search for it yourself.</li>
					<li>Enormous reach and precision with a simple solution.</li>
					<li>Simple and flexible integration.</li>
					<li>Giving users in the area instructions via InfoLight,  emergency services precious time and space to do their job.</li>
					<li>By integrating with already established apps, we can reach out to most people.</li>
					<li>PR-friendly profile and governmental subsidized development</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<h2>Reaches most people</h2>

			<div class="blikkfang">
				.. directly to users in a specific geographic area.
			</div>

			<p>
				InfoLight has a huge range and precision in one single system. 
				The solution allows emergency services and other public agencies to customize alerts and send them directly to users in a specific geographic area. 
				Users with notification-ready apps will then be notified if they are in the alerted area. As long as the alerts are active, new users with who move into the alerted area will also receive these notifications.
			</p>

				<source src="video/varsler.mp4" type="video/mp4">
			</video>

			<h2>Easier to receive</h2>

			<p>
				It's easier to receive information than to seek it yourself, especially if you are in the middle of a critical situation.
				By using apps that already have a large user base, we can reach and alert a large part of the population, even in the startup phase. 
			</p>

			<h2>"Alert-ready" apps</h2>

			<p>
				Our modular solution makes it easy for app developers to integrate emergency notification from InfoLight into their own mobile apps. 
				As soon as the module is implemented by developers and the app is updated on the user's smartphone, it is "alert-ready." 
				After updating the app, users will be requested if it is desirable to enable emergency notifications, and it is up to the user to use the functionality. 
				The user can enable or disable emergency notifications in the app, as desired.
			</p>

			<h2>PR-friendly</h2>

			<p>
				From a public relations point-of-view, helping to build Norway's new emergency alert platform is exclusively positive. 
				After all, it is society's best interest to be able to alert as many as possible when emergency situations and extraordinary events occur. 
				Also, a notification-ready app will significantly increase the likelihood that the user activates location services in the mobile app. 
				This in combination with increased media coverage will reflect and lead to increased trust within the user base.
				In order to further lower the threshold for implementation, developers may also apply for subsidies for development and integration of the emergency notification-module. 
				More information about the application process can be found at the Department of ICT and renewal.
			</p>

			<h2>Standalone app</h2>
			

			<p>
				We will also offer a separate app which enables the same notifications and capabilities as the modular solution. 
				Additionally, it is possible to add your own locations if you wish to receive notifications for other places than your current location.

			<h1>About us</h1>

			<p>
				We are a group of 7 students who call ourselves InfoLight, currently studying Applied Computer Technology at Oslo and Akershus University College.
				This is our solution to a problem we think is relevant to people's everyday lives and can provide a better experience of stressful situations and emergencies. 
				The solution is meant to be subsidized by the state, which means this should be a non-profit solution.
				Feel free to contact us <a href="mailto:s326289@stud.hioa.no?Subject=InfoLight" target="_top">by email</a> if you have any questions.
