Do you know someone who has experienced an emergency where they have not received any information or follow-up? "What's going on?" "Where am I safe?" "What can I do?" These are questions that often arise during emergencies. 
In these situations, when time is an issue, It may also be difficult to find relevant information quickly, which could lead to misunderstandings and potentially dangerous situations.
To date there is no digital platform for emergency notifications in Norway. We are InfoLight and we seek to supply a solution to this problem.
