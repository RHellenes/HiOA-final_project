Set in an information- and society-aware focus, helping to build Norway's new emergency alert platform is exclusively positive. 
After all, it is best for society to get the most alert when emergency situations and extraordinary events occur. 
A notification-ready app will also significantly increase the likelihood that the user activates location services in the mobile app. 
This in combination with increased media coverage will reflect and lead to increased trust within the user base.
In order to further lower the threshold for implementation, developers may also apply for subsidies for development and integration of the emergency notification-module. 
More information about the application process can be found at the Department of ICT and renewal.
