Our modular solution makes it easy for app developers to integrate emergency notification from InfoLight into their own mobile apps. 
As soon as the module is implemented by developers and the app is updated on the user's smartphone, it is "alert-ready." 
After updating the app, users will be requested if it is desirable to enable emergency notifications, and it is up to the user to use the functionality. 
The user can enable or disable emergency notifications in the app, as desired.
