We are a group of 7 students who call ourselves InfoLight, currently studying Applied Computer Technology at Oslo and Akershus University College.
This is our solution to a problem we think is relevant to people's everyday lives and can provide a better experience of stressful situations and emergencies. 
The solution is meant to be subsidized by the state, which means this should be a non-profit solution.
Feel free to contact us if you have any questions.
